* building its own docker image :

        docker build -t pandas-data-cleaning . && docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/output:/home/jovyan/work/output -e NB_UID=`id -u` pandas-data-cleaning

* running its own [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/gmiretti/pandas-data-cleaning) image (to be pushed)

        docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/output:/home/jovyan/work/output -e NB_UID=`id -u` gmiretti/pandas-data-cleaning


* with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (to be tested)
* with [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (to be tested):
  * at https://colab.research.google.com/github/gmiretti/pandas-data-cleaning/blob/master/notebooks/Data-Cleaning.ipynb
